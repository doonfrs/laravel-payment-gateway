## Design Rules
- Use tailwind 4.1 ( latest )
- Always take care of dark / light mode
- Please try not to create svg as much as possible, and use blade icons
- We are using tailwind 4, please make sure to not to use deprecated classes / code https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#removed-deprecated-utilities and if you encounter an old code, upgrade it
- Never use <style> just tailwind


## Important for composer and artisan commands  
* This is a package not a full laravel project, please do not try to run artisan commands

## Framework
* This is a laravel 12 project, please make sure to follow the latest laravel 12 standards
- always remember the langauge folder is inside /lang and it is not inside /resource/lang because it is laravel 12
